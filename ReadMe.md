Player Movement - 
Left/Right to rotate
Forward/Back to move

Notes - Style:
Console works well but constrast would be adjusted in assignment beta ;)
Fog controls work, but fog must be toggled on to take effect
Getting the UIGesture system working with the existing old api we used for everything else was tricky but we made it work.
